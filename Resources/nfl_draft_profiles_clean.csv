Alex attempted only five passes as a freshman reserve QB in 2002.  He took over the starting job three games into his sophomore season vs. Cal in 2003 and wound up completing 65-percent of his passes for 2,247 yards with 15 touchdowns compared to just three interceptions.   He also rushed for 452 yards in 2003.  As a junior in 2004, Smith started all 12 games, went undefeated as a starter and led the Utes to a Fiesta Bowl win over Pittsburgh.  Prior to declaring himself available for the 2005 NFL draft, Smith completed 66.1-percent of his passes for 2,624 yards with 28 TD's and four INT's, while also rushing for another 563 yards and 10 TD's.  Smith could have used another year at the collegiate level in order to bulk up and improve his overall strength, but his decision makes sense following a nearly perfect junior season and with head coach Urban Meyer leaving for Florida.  Smith still needs to get bigger and he lacks ideal arm strength.  He also will have a big adjustment transitioning from the mid-major college level (Mountain West Conference) to the NFL.  However, there isn't a more intelligent quarterback in this class and few are as competitive.  Smith is a fine athlete, he has the frame to get bigger and he has enough arm strength to get by at the next level if he does everything else correctly.  In our opinion, Smith ranks just below Cal's Aaron Rodgers as the second quarterback in the 2005 class.  He likely would have been the fourth quarterback selected (behind Eli Manning, Philip Rivers and Ben Roethlisberger) a year ago, but in what is a noticeably weak top of the board in this year's draft Smith could very likely be a top-10 selection.","There isn't a lot that separates Aaron Rodgers from Alex Smith. Rodgers has the better arm, but Smith has the bigger frame. What it ultimately came down to was that new 49ers coach Mike Nolan fell in love with Smith's intelligence, charisma and overall intangibles -- and who can blame him?<br>

He did not take over as Cal's starter in 2003 until the fifth game of the season against Illinois but wound up leading the team to a 7-3 record as its starter.  He completed 61.6 percent of his passes (215-of-349) for 2,903 yards, 19 touchdowns and only five interceptions in 13 games played in 2003, while also setting a school record for passing yards and completions in the 2003 Insight Bowl.  Earlier in his career, Rodgers has had some problems with ball security and made too many mistakes in when in the red zone.  There also was a minor durability issue after he had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee during the offseason prior to the 2004 CFB season.  However, Rodgers bounced back from the surgery with no ill-effects, had another tremendously productive season as a senior (67.5-percent, 2,320 yards with 23 TD's and seven INT's) and significantly cut down on his turnovers and red zone miscues.  Rodgers doesn't have great size and he could stand to get stronger, but he did measure in at 6-2, 223 pounds at the combine, which is at least adequate.  There has to be a minor concern regarding the wide-open quarterback friendly system that Rodgers played in at Cal, as it makes reads easier on quarterbacks and it also balloons their numbers with a lot of short passes that are turned into long gains.  Jeff Tedford is, however, an excellent quarterback groomer and he has done a terrific job with Rodgers' mechanics.  With two full years of starting experience under Tedford, Rodgers should be better prepared for the NFL than most other quarterbacks in this class.  Many of Rodgers' attempts in college were underneath, but there is no denying his arm strength and there is certainly no denying his accuracy and game-management skills.   In our opinion, Rodgers is the most complete quarterback in the 2005 draft class and he should be the first overall quarterback taken ‚Äì likely somewhere in the top-five.  ","Rodgers was talked about as a potential No. 1 overall selection, but some bad luck and some concerns about his throwing motion and ability to adjust to NFL offenses sent him sliding. Nevertheless, there are worse places to land than as Brett Favre's understudy.<br>

He became the first freshman to start the season opener at quarterback for Auburn since Stan White in 1990.  Campbell started eight games in 2001, six games in 2002 and all 13 games in 2003.  He had by far his best season as a senior in 2004 when he completed 69.6-percent of his passes for 2,700 yards and threw 19 touchdowns and just six interceptions, while leading the Tigers to a perfect 13-0 record. Campbell has always had excellent size, good athletic ability and above average arm strength, but his poor decision making skills, lack of poise in the pocket, indecisiveness and erratic arm haunted him early in his collegiate career.  Throughout his first three seasons as a starter, Campbell consistently held onto the ball too long, threw too many passes up for grabs when he ran out of time, missed open receivers downfield and overthrew too many of the receivers that he did find open.  However, No player improved his draft value more in 2004 than Campbell.  After struggling through three extremely inconsistent and unfulfilling seasons, Campbell thrived as a senior in what was his fourth offensive scheme in four years.  New offensive coordinator Al Borges found the right fit for Campbell, as his West Coast scheme simplified things and gave Campbell a lot more definitive reads to make.  As his confidence improved, so too did his production.  Most impressive was Campbell's improvement in regards to his decision-making skills, as he threw 13 more touchdowns (19) than interceptions (6) in 2004.  Campbell has the physical tools of a first round pick but there are still questions about his downfield accuracy and ability to see the entire field.  That's why we grade Campbell out as a solid second round prospect. ","When the Redskins traded into the first round earlier in the week, many observers dismissed the notion they were targeting Campbell. But having landed CB Carlos Rogers at No. 9, Washington could afford to pick a QB who might take a couple of years to fully develop.<br>

Lee Owens, who recruited Frye and was the head coach at Akron for Frye's first three seasons, was fired at the end of the 2003 season, which was the main reason why Frye is contemplating the move.  However, he made a wise decision to return to school for his senior season for a few good reasons ‚Äì most importantly that he needed the extra experience that he got as a senior.   Frye's supporting cast was not nearly as strong in 2004 as it was previously, but he showed a lot of toughness, durability and leadership skills.  He also has impressed with his mental capacity after quickly digesting the new offensive scheme.  In terms of overall production, Frye rewrote Akron's record books at the quarterback position, throwing for 11,049 yards and 64 TD's compared to just 32 INT's as a four-year starter.  Frye is a ""gamer"" that doesn't necessarily wow you with his natural skills but finds ways to get the job done.  He has good size above average athletic ability and adequate arm strength. In terms of physical tools and development, Frye is a notch below the three former MAC quarterbacks that have succeeded him in the NFL -- Chad Pennington (Jets), Byron Leftwich (Jaguars) and Ben Roethlisberger (Steelers) ‚Äì but he is still a talented overall quarterback with the potential to develop into a starter at the next level. There are several quarterbacks competing to be the third taken after juniors' Aaron Rodgers (Cal) and Alex Smith (Utah).  Frye is among the leading candidates and, at the very least, should be one of the top-five quarterbacks to come off the board, likely between the second round and early-third.  ",,

He began the 2002 season as a backup but quickly took over the starting job and exploded onto the national scene with 3,877 passing yards and 28 touchdowns compared to 15 interceptions in coach Dirk Koetter's wide-open offensive attack.   However, while Walter didn't play terribly as a junior in 2003, he did not make the progress that was expected.  His supporting cast was not what it was in '02 when he had go-to WR Shaun McDonald and he also suffered an ankle injury against UCLA that forced him to miss one game and hindered him for the final three games.  Walter was enjoying a bounce-back season as a senior in 2004 before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury versus Arizona.  The injury required surgery and prevented him from participating in the Senior Bowl and from working out at the combine. Walter reminds us a lot of a young, leaner, quicker Drew Bledsoe.  Walter is a tall pocket passer with great arm strength and a calm demeanor.  While he isn't a good athlete, he is a little bit quicker than Bledsoe and he can move around within the pocket and avoid the rush a lot better than Bledsoe can.  Like Bledsoe, however, Walter can fit the ball into a lot of tight spots that other quarterbacks can't but he also tries to fit the ball into some spots that even he can't slip it into, which leads to obvious problems.  Walter was having a strong senior season until suffering the shoulder injury.  While durability is a bit of an overall concern in regards to Walter's longevity in the NFL, the injury itself shouldn't cause him to drop much.  Walter will need time to develop and he by no means is a complete product at this time. However, his upside is great enough for a team to understandably take a chance on him in the second round.

He started 52 consecutive games over four seasons (an NCAA record), led the Bulldogs to a 42-10 record during that time, four straight bowl games, three straight national top six finishes, two SEC Eastern Division titles (2002 and 2003) and the 2002 SEC championship. Greene became the ""winningest"" Division 1-A quarterback in NCAA history with 42 career victories breaking the old mark of 39 by Tennessee's Peyton Manning. During that time he also led the Bulldogs to a 15-2 record when playing on the opponents' home field. Most impressive about Greene are his leadership and proven ability to manage a game.  Greene doesn't have elite overall physical tools but he's accurate, he knows how to win and he is a high-character player that does things the right way.  In many ways, he reminds us of Patriots' QB Tom Brady.  Greene won't be drafted as late as Brady was (6th round), but his lack of ideal size, strength and mobility will likely cause him to slip to the third or fourth round of the upcoming draft.  He is one of those players, however, with the intangibles to overcome his physical limitations in the NFL, which is why we think he eventually could emerge as a starter at the next level.  ",,

He split time as a sophomore in 2002 before developing into a fulltime starter as a junior in 2003, as he started all 13 games and finished with 2,885 yards, completing 60.6-percent of his attempts, with 15 TD's and seven INT's. Orton had more of a rollercoaster season as a senior in 2004, as he was one of the ""hottest"" quarterbacks in the nation for the first half of the season but cooled off in the second half, partially due to a lingering hip injury.  Orton finished the season completing 60.7-percent of his attempts for 3,090 yards with 31 TD's and five INT's.  Orton spent a good majority of his time at Purdue working out of the shotgun and he struggled with the adjustment of taking snaps from under center during the Senior Bowl.  As was the case with former Purdue star Drew Brees (Chargers), it may take Orton longer to make the transition to the NFL than other quarterbacks that had better experience in a more traditional offense.  Orton needs to improve the quickness of his delivery and become much more consistent when put under pressure.  Otherwise, Orton has the physical tools and makeup to develop into a solid starter in the NFL.  He has the size, arm strength, accuracy and mind that it takes to succeed at the next level.  There's no question that Orton is a risky ""boom or bust"" type of prospect, but he has enough physical tools and was successful enough at the highest level of college football to warrant second round consideration in the 2005 NFL draft.

LeFors led Louisville to an 11-1 record as a senior in 2004, completing 73.5-percent of his attempts for 2,596 yards with 20 TD's compared to just three INT's.  Lefors' lack of size is really his only glaring weakness.  Lefors shows very good footwork, impressive athleticism and good technique and accuracy when throwing on the run.  His arm is also stronger than he gets credit for.  In terms of work ethic, character, toughness and overall intangibles, Lefors has everything you look for in a quarterback.  Lefors is still nothing more than a mid-round prospect that will need to be drafted by a team that employs a West Coast scheme (such as the Eagles and Seahawks) or for a team like the Broncos that works to get its quarterbacks outside of the pocket on a lot of play-action and bootlegs.  However, with his incredible senior season and strong showing at the East-West Shrine game, Lefors' draft value is definitely on the rise.    ",,

He also was named MVP of the Motor City Bowl.  Orlovsky has played well in games against top competition; he is a proven winner and a tough competitor.  He has the size, and intangibles to compete for a starting job in the NFL, but he will need more time than other quarterback prospects in this class to develop and he also has enough physical limitations that he'll need to be in the right system in order to succeed at the next level.  Orlovsky is a scrappy player with the potential to develop into a Jake Delhomme type, but he's not ever going to be able to carry a team.  He needs to become much more consistent as a passer in order to make up for what he lacks in terms of arm strength.  In our opinion, Orlovsky is a good value early on Day 2 but he is an overrated player that will struggle to be anything more than a backup in the NFL.

McPherson took over as a starter at Florida State in just his sophomore season in 2002 but was kicked off the team following a well-publicized gambling scandal.  He tried to enroll at Tennessee State but the NCAA made it nearly impossible, which led to his decision to turn pro and play in the Arena Football League.  McPherson quickly developed into one of the most effective and dynamic quarterbacks in the AFL, playing for the Indiana Firebirds.  Now, at the age of 20, McPherson has elected to make himself available for the 2005 NFL draft.  McPherson spent his pre-draft process training with Florida with former teammates Craphonso Thorpe, P.K. Sam and Bryant McFadden.  What makes McPherson so intriguing as a mid-to-late round draft prospect in 2005 is that he has the physical tools of a Day 1 pick.  Few quarterbacks in this class are as talented.  McPherson obviously has a lot of baggage.  He also still needs to improve his mechanics, lower body strength and consistency on the deep ball.  However, after spending time breaking down film of McPherson in the AFL and also after talking to people that have been around the much more mature McPherson recently, we feel strongly that he's worth the risk early on Day 2.  McPherson has learned tough lessons, he never brought down any others that were involved in his off-the-field issues with him and he has grown up a great deal in the past couple of years.  With good size, an extremely strong arm and terrific overall athleticism, there should be a lot of intrigue surrounding McPherson on draft weekend.  ",,

He lacks good top-end speed but he has adequate-to-good mobility for his size.  His intangibles, work-ethic and leadership skills are outstanding.  If Anderson is going to reach his full potential he needs time and very good coaching because his accuracy is inconsistent and his decision-making skills, while improved, are not where they need to be at this point.

Randall had his best season as a senior in 2004, when he led the Hokies to a 10-3 record while completing 55.6-percent of his attempts for 2,264 yards with 21 TD's and nine INT's.  He also rushed for 511 yards and three TD's. Randall is a developmental prospect that needs to improve his ability to read defenses and find the open man when the primary receiver is covered. Randall's lack of prototypical size and just adequate arm strength greatly limits his potential, but he possesses outstanding mobility and he developed into a much more consistent playmaker in his final season at Virginia Tech.  If he can improve his mechanics and overall accuracy, he has the potential to develop into an adequate backup. He is a long way away from that point now, though, and will need time on a practice squad or in NFL Europe.  His athletic ability and huge improvement as a senior should solidify him a spot in the late rounds of the draft.   ",,

He was benched for a period of time as a sophomore in 2002 and a junior in 2003.  He also has missed time as a senior in 2004 because of injury and wound up losing his job to his replacement, Wyatt Sexton.  As a senior in 2004, Rix played in only 8-of-12 games and wound up completing 51-percent of his attempts for 865 yards with three TD's compared to seven INT's. Rix showed tremendous upside early in his career but he has failed to reach his potential on the field, while also frustrating his coaches and teammates with his arrogant attitude and numerous minor off-the-field incidents.  The bottom line is that if Rix had the mental attributes to go along with his physical tools, he'd be a first round prospect.  However, throughout his four seasons at Florida State he continued to prove incapable of managing a game and working within an offensive scheme, which is why his draft value doesn't come close to matching his natural ability.  A team might take a chance on him in the middle rounds but we wouldn't waste a pick on him any higher than the fifth round.   ",,

He started the last 10 games of his true freshman season and started every game of his sophomore and junior seasons (2002-'03).  Guidugli got off to a slow start in 2004 in a new system but he made huge strides as the season progressed and was one of the most effective passers in the nation by the end of the regular season.  Guidugli finished his senior season completing 61.4-percent of his attempts for 2,633 yards with 26 TD's and eight INT's.  An erratic arm and inconsistent decision-making skills have always plagued Guidugli.  Character is also a concern after being arrested twice in college ‚Äì once for underage drinking in November 2002 and another time for punching another man during a fight that broke out in an intramural basketball game in March 2003.   However, Guidugli seems to have matured off the field a great deal over the course of the past year and he played his best football during the second half of his senior campaign in 2004 before he suffered a non-football related hand injury that kept him out of the Louisville game.  Also, to his credit, he showed a lot of toughness when playing in his team's Fort Worth Bowl victory over Marshall.  The intriguing aspect of drafting Guidugli as a Day 2 developmental prospect is that his mechanics are still extremely raw, which means he could really respond under good coaching in the NFL.  Guidugli has good size, adequate-to-good arm strength and is a decent athlete.  He is a competitive, durable and tough player who finally seems to be coming into his own.  ",,

He rushed for 889 yards and 16 touchdowns that year. Washington was also named the 2004 Big East Player of the Year. Washington is clearly a better athlete than he is a football player at this point and he will need time to develop before he's even prepared to compete for a backup role at the next level.  However, his upside is intriguing.   Washington has adequate size to go along with his excellent arm strength and mobility. A team should take a chance on Washington in the final couple of rounds of the upcoming draft because he has developmental upside at quarterback, he should be able to contribute on special teams and, if he doesn't make it as a quarterback, he's athletic enough to attempt a move to another skill position.

Long has adequate height, is intelligent, has a quick release and is a decent athlete.  However, he's too lean and his lack of arm strength is glaring.  His only chance to make it in the NFL will be in a West Coast scheme and there's a good chance that he never develops into anything more than a reserve if he does make it.

Ochs led Montana to a 12-3 record as a senior in 2004, completing 68.7-percent of his attempts for 3,807 yards with 33 TD's and eight INT's.  Ochs had a roller-coaster of a collegiate career but he ended on a high note.  He improved his accuracy greatly as a senior and he shows enough arm strength to make the necessary throws in the NFL.  However, durability, marginal size and a tendency to hold onto the ball too long are big concerns.

The DI-AA level of competition is also good reason for concern.  However, while his upside is limited, he still has the potential to develop into a quality reserve in the NFL because he's an accurate quarterback who doesn't make many mistakes, knows how to manage a game and takes care of the football.

For the season, Durant finished completing 59.5-percent of his attempts for 2,238 yards with 17 TD's and nine INT's.  He also rushed for 188 yards and one TD.  Durant is undersized and lacks prototypical NFL quarterback ""measurables"" but he is one of the fastest and most athletic quarterbacks in the 2005 class, which is why a team will likely take a chance on him in the final couple of rounds.  He doesn't have great upside at the quarterback position but he has the athleticism and arm strength to try him out there first before attempting to move him to a different position (such as WR, RB or DB).

He also rushed for 1,050 yards on 155 carries while leading the Longhorns to a BCS National Championship. Prior to the significant improvements that Young made as a passer between his sophomore and junior seasons; it was our opinion that Young would need to make a position change in order to make a living in the NFL.  However, he has made significant strides in terms of his arm strength, accuracy and vertical passing abilities over the course of the last year.  Young still has much room to improve in terms of his mechanics, release point, accuracy and ability to take snaps under center and read coverage while dropping.  But while another year wouldn't have hurt him, Young would not have improved in those areas had he returned to school to spend another season working out of the shotgun in a ""read-option"" offensive system.  The bottom line is that because he is such an elite athlete with rare upside at the quarterback position, Young grades out as a high first-round pick.","There is a lot to like about Young's arm strength, mobility and desire to have the ball in his hands when the game is on the line. However, taking Young here isn't the right move in our opinion. He needs to work on his release point and ability to read defenses, so it will be difficult for him to step into a starting role immediately, which he might have to do if the Titans release Steve McNair, as expected.<br>

Leinart started for his second season at quarterback as a junior in 2004, when he completed 269-of-412 passes (65.3%) for 3,322 yards and 33 TDs with just 6 interceptions, plus he rushed for 3 TDs.  As a senior in 2005, Leinart completed 65.7-percent of his attempts for 3,815 yards with 28 TD's and eight INT's.  He won the Heisman Trophy in 2004.  In three seasons as a fulltime starter (2003-'05), Leinart was 37-2 in games that he started and he led his team to back-to-back national championships during his first two seasons.  Leinart is a southpaw quarterback with great size, leadership skills and intangibles.  As a potential top-five draft pick, Leinart's lack of speed is a bit concerning, as are his minor durability issues and lack of elite arm strength. He also has been surrounded by the best supporting cast in college football during his three seasons as a starter.   However, Leinart still has enough physical tools and the exceptional intangibles that it takes to develop into a good starting quarterback in the NFL. He is quick enough in the pocket to buy some second-chance passing opportunities, he has played through pain and he has better arm strength than several above average starters in the NFL right now.  He also possesses outstanding accuracy as a passer.  Very much like the Patriots' Tom Brady, Leinart simply knows how to win. That is why, despite his lack of elite all-around physical tools, Leinart is the premier quarterback prospect in the 2006 class.","Talk about getting the most bang for your buck. Few experts thought Leinart would slip this far, and although Arizona has more urgent needs, incumbent QB Kurt Warner has had problems staying healthy and isn't getting any younger. Improving the depth behind Warner and drafting an heir apparent makes sense.<br>

Despite being overmatched on almost a weekly basis, Cutler found ways to keep his team in games.  He has good size and mobility to go along with his outstanding arm strength.  However, Cutler is still unpolished and will need lots of mechanical work in order to reach his full potential in the NFL.  For much of his career, Cutler was an underrated prospect that did not get the attention that he deserved.  However, after a strong senior season and good showings at the Senior Bowl and NFL Scouting Combine, Cutler has become one of the more over-hyped prospects in the 2006 class.

However, with behind a patchwork offensive line and with a complete facelift at the wide receiver position, Whitehurst struggled early as a junior.

After a strong start in 2003, Croyle was lost for the season late in the third quarter of the Western Carolina game when he tore the ACL in his right knee. He had surgery on Sept. 20. By that point in the season, he had completed 67-percent of his passes (44 of 66) for 534 yards and six touchdowns. He had not thrown an interception in those 66 attempts.  As a senior in 2005, Croyle completed 59.6-percent of his attempts for 2,499 yards with 14 TD's and four INT's.   Croyle has some upside because of his outstanding arm strength and leadership skills.  However, he's not a great athlete, he has below-average size, and he has a terrible history of durability issues.   While he did stay healthy and play well during his senior season in 2005, Croyle does not enter the NFL with great playing experience at the collegiate level and we also have huge doubts regarding his potential to stay healthy for an entire 16-game season if anointed as a starter in the NFL.

Instead of returning for his senior season, Jacobs elected to take his chances in the 2006 draft -- a sizeable mistake in our opinion.  Jacobs has all the physical tools necessary to develop into a starting quarterback in the NFL.  He has great size, as well as good arm strength and mobility.   He can be an accurate short-to-intermediate passer and he has shown flashes of good decision-making skills.  However, Jacobs will need a lot of work in order to polish his game for the next level.  His release point is too low and his consistency as a deep-ball passer needs to improve.  He also comes from a pass-friendly, shotgun-oriented offensive scheme, which means he  likely will require more developmental time than other quarterback prospects with similar skill sets.  That's why, in our opinion, Jacobs is worth drafting in the late second-to-third round range, but no earlier than the middle of the second round.",,

Gradkowski is a tough quarterback with adequate arm strength and good athletic ability.   He was an efficient passer at the collegiate level but it must be taken into consideration that he played in a passer-friendly spread scheme.  His lack of size and injury history also lead to serious durability questions regarding his future.  In all reality, Gradkowski grades out as a potential backup quarterback in the NFL and would have to defy several odds to become a starter.  There is an awful lot to like about his intangibles, toughness and competitiveness, which is why he is worth taking a chance on in the fourth-to-fifth round range of the 2006 draft.",,

Shockley redshirted in 2001 and played as a rotating backup for much of the next three seasons (2002-'04).  As a junior in 2004, Shockley completed just 43.3-percent of his 60 attempts for 464 yards with four TDs and one INT.  He also rushed for 113 yards on 24 carries.  As a senior in 2005, Shockley missed one game (Florida) because of injury and completed 55.8-percent of his attempts for 2,588 yards with 24 TDs and five INT's in the 12 games he started.  He also rushed for 322 yards on 78 carries.  Shockley made strides as a passer in 2005 but he remains a better athlete than quarterback at this point.  He lacks ideal size, is erratic and unpolished as a pocket passer.  He also has limited game experience as a starting quarterback.  Shockley would be an awfully big project at the quarterback position in the NFL.  However, because he is such a fine athlete with good running skills, Shockley might even be worth drafting in the middle of Day 2 with the intention of moving him to a WR/Slot-back position if he doesn't show enough progress as a quarterback early in his career.",,

Russell took over as the fulltime started for the first 12 contests in 2005, dealt with a nagging wrist injury that required offseason surgery, and missed the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl because of a shoulder injury sustained in the SEC Championship game.  He finished the year with 2,443 passing yards, 15 touchdowns, and nine interceptions with a 60.5-completion percentage.  In 2006, Russell became a unanimous first team All-SEC selection after starting all 13 games and throwing for 3,129 yards, 28 touchdowns, and just eight interceptions, while completing an LSU-record 67.8-percent of his passes.  He has also rushed for four touchdowns over the past three seasons.  Finished career with a 25-4 record as a starter, including eight fourth-quarter come-from-behind victories. <p> Russell is a big, smooth, strong-armed quarterback with exceptional overall physical tools.  He is still developing as a passer but he made significant strides in regards to his timing, poise, decision-making and accuracy during the second-half of his junior season.  It's hard not to draw comparisons between Russell and Daunte Culpepper (Dolphins), although Russell has a stronger arm and seems to be the more flexible and durable athlete.  While there's no question his ""floor"" is lower than Brady Quinn's, Russell has the highest ""ceiling"" of any quarterback in this class.  Russell is a top-five caliber prospect and he could be the first overall selection in the 2007 draft.","Russell is the obvious pick for the Raiders because he fills a pressing need and has the most value at the position. Although he needs to continue to improve his decision making and work on his footwork, he has rare size and arm strength.

In 2006, he once again started every game (13) and completed 61.9-percent of his passes for 3,426 yards and 32 more touchdowns (37) than interceptions (seven) while garnering a second team All-American selection (media).  <p>Quinn brings to the table tremendous experience as a four-year starter; the final two of which he has thrived under head coach Charlie Weis in a pro-style offensive scheme.  He possesses a fine blend of arm strength, size and intelligence.  Quinn also possesses adequate quickness in the pocket and overall athleticism for his size.   While there's no arguing Quinn's mental and physical makeup, we do have reservations regarding his peaks and valleys as a college player.  Too much of his production came against sub-par competition and too many of his struggles came in the ""big games"" versus the top-tier defenses he faced.  Overall, Quinn remains a top-10 prospect in the 2007 class but we would take Russell ahead of him.","Quinn has the poise to step in right away and enough confidence to learn from his mistakes along the way.

He started 10 of BYU's 11 games in 2004 and passed for 2,563 yards, with a 56-percent completion percentage, and 15 touchdowns compared to eight interceptions.  Beck staved off Matt Berry for the fulltime starting rights in 2005 by throwing for 3,709 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions with a 64.5 completion percentage in 12 games, which earned him an All-Mountain West first-team selection.

In 2004, Stanton started seven of the 10 games that he played in (limited by a separated shoulder), completing 64.1-percent of his attempts for 1,601 yards, eight touchdowns, and six interceptions.  He also rushed for 687 yards on 96 attempts scoring five touchdowns to earn an honorable mention All-Big 10 selection (coaches and media).  Stanton started all 11contests in 2005 despite suffering a hand injury late in the year, completed 66.7-percent of his throws for 3,077 yards with 22 touchdowns compared to 12 interceptions, and rushed for 338 yards and four touchdowns on 121 carries, receiving another honorable mention accolade (media).

He has the size, arm strength and quick delivery to succeed in the NFL.  He also shows adequate mobility and a good work ethic.  However, he makes a lot of mistakes and has gotten into some bad habits due to the marginal supporting cast.  He also has some durability concerns, which will cause him to slip a bit.

In 2004, Taylor transferred to Butler County Community College (Kansas) where he was named an NJCAA All-American after throwing for nearly 3,000 yards and 29 touchdowns.  Taylor also led Butler County CC to the NJCAA Championship game that season.

In his four-year college career (2004-‚Äò07), Ryan played in 45 games (32 starts), completing 807 passes on 1,347 attempts (59.9 percent) for 9,313 yards, 56 touchdowns and 37 interceptions. As a senior, he attracted attention as a Heisman Trophy candidate and finished the season ranked ninth in the nation in total offense (4,509 yards). Ryan missed one game in 2006 (Buffalo) after breaking a bone in his left foot.As expected, Ryan thrived in a more wide open system as a senior.  He also proved to be more mobile and accurate than in 2006, when he was clearly bothered by a broken bone in his left foot.  While he will never be a running threat, Ryan displays the feet and pocket presence to buy second-chance passing opportunities. He will still occasionally miss an open receiver and he also is forcing more throws as a senior, but part of that can be attributed to him being asked to shoulder the offense due to a sputtering running attack.  Regardless, Ryan has the best combination of intelligence, leadership, size, accuracy, arm strength and competitiveness in this year's quarterback class.  Hence, Ryan earns our highest grade at the position and one of the highest grades in the entire 2008 class.","Matt Ryan doesn't have the arm strength of a JaMarcus Russell, and he isn't a dynamic open-field runner, but he is clearly the most NFL-ready quarterback in this year's draft class. He has better-than-average arm strength, he's accurate and he understands the game. A lot has been made of the amount of interceptions he threw during his senior season at Boston College, but it's important to remember that he didn't have a strong receiving corps and that BC put the ball in the air far more often in 2007 than in years past.

He joined Delaware in August 2005, but he didn't see any action that fall. He started all 11 games in 2006, completing 264 passes on 417 attempts (63.3 percent) for 18 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. As a senior, he played and started in 15 games, passing for 331 completions on 521 attempts for 4,263 yards, 23 touchdowns and only five interceptions for a 144.91 passer rating. Flacco also scored four rushing TDs. Although he started his collegiate career at Pittsburgh, the bulk of Flacco's production came at Delaware against a lower level of competition. So there are questions about his ability to adjust to the speed and complexities of NFL defenses. He also lacks experience working under center, so he has much to learn when it comes to his footwork and reading a defense while dropping.  However, there's no question he has the natural ability to make the leap.   Flacco shares a lot of the same qualities with Ben Roethlisberger.  He is deceptively mobile, throws well on the run and has arguably the strongest arm of any signal caller in the 2008 class.  Also, of the six quarterbacks at this year's Senior Bowl, Flacco showed the most improvement from the beginning to the end of the week.  It was important for the small school product to prove he can hang with the ‚Äúbig boys‚Äù and Flacco did just that.  Don't be surprised if he comes off the 2008 draft board in the second-to-third round range.","Baltimore fills its greatest need here. Flacco certainly has the makings of a franchise quarterback.

From where we stand, the experience has allowed Brohm to showcase aspects of his game never seen before.  First off, he has shown mental toughness in dealing with the adversity.  Secondly, he has eased concerns regarding durability by remaining healthy despite taking a beating throughout his senior season. On the plus side; he is a smart, hard working pocket passer with very good accuracy and the toughness to hang in the pocket.  On the minus side; he lacks ideal mobility, arm strength and leadership skills. Also, Brohm comes with some durability baggage.  With all that in mind, Brohm projects as a first-round selection but we still think he has too many weaknesses to stamp him with a top-15 grade.","Brian Brohm, like a lot of other young quarterbacks, can have a hard time beating pressure. He also needs to improve his decision-making, and he doesn't have great mobility and takes some big hits.

He set school career marks in completions (828), attempts (1,387), passing yards (9,715) and passing touchdowns (87). He has also rushed for three career touchdowns. Despite missing three games as a senior (leg and shoulder injuries), Henne passed for 1,938 yards and 17 touchdowns in just 10 games. In addition to good size and arm strength, Henne brings to the table rare experience as a four-year starting quarterback at Michigan.   He's not the type of quarterback that can carry a team but he does an excellent job of managing games and distributing the ball to his playmakers.  He was considered the most durable quarterback in the senior class prior to the 2007 season.  However, knee and shoulder injuries have caused him to miss significant time.  Henne is the type of quarterback that will shine in pre-draft workouts because he is such a gifted natural passer when he can set his feet and throw unhurried.  However, his lack of mobility and erratic decision-making skills when under pressure are legitimate concerns in our opinion.  Henne should come off the board in the second round of the upcoming draft.  His intangibles, toughness and work ethic will allow him to overcome some physical limitations but his NFL career could be defined by how much he can improve his feet over the next few years.","Henne has good size and very good arm strenghth, so he can find the open receiver and get him the ball. Much like Brohm, he's a student of the game; his ability to break down defense should improve with time. However, he's a little statuesque in the pocket, so he has problems buying time in the pocket and is not a threat to scramble.

O'Connell missed six games in 2006 after suffering a thumb injury to his throwing hand, which required surgery. O'Connell's play has substantially improved over the past two years and there is a high ceiling on his potential.  He possesses the size, mobility and arm strength of an NFL starter. However, O'Connell is a developmental prospect that did not play the highest level in college and still has lots to learn in terms of footwork and the mental portion of the game.  In order to reach his full potential at the next level, O'Connell will need a patient organization with a bright quarterback coach.   O'Connell is worth the risk for such a team in the final few rounds  but no higher than Round 5.","He has prototypical size and is an above-average athlete. O'Connell has excellent and efficient feet with his drops, and the arm strength to make all the throws.

He missed three games as a senior after breaking the tip of the middle finger on his throwing hand, but he still finished with 23 TDs in 10 games. He completed 63.2 percent of his passes for an average of 236.1 passing yards per game. Booty finally got his chance to take over the helm in 2006 after spending three seasons sitting behind former Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart. Booty lacks good size and arm strength, which puts a bit of a ceiling on his draft potential. He also has had some durability issues, including a broken finger on his throwing hand as a senior. However, he is a mechanically sound passer with very good decision-making skills.  He knows how to read defenses and go through progressions.  He also can be a very accurate short-to-intermediate passer.  He will fit best in a West Coast system at the next level.  In our opinion, while Booty might lack the physical skills to emerge as good starter in the NFL, he is the type of hard working, cerebral quarterback that could overcome the odds. At the very least, he should carve a lengthy career as a reliable backup.   A team operating out of that offensive system should view Booty as a good value in the third-round range.","Booty doesn't have elite arm strength or size, but moves his feet well and is accurate, making him a perfect fit for the Vikings' West Coast offense.

He also rushed 153 times for 625 yards (4.1 average) and three touchdowns in that span. Dixon was knocked out of a game in 2005 with a concussion. He exploded as a senior, completing 67.7 percent of his pass attempts for 2,136 yards, 20 touchdowns and just four interceptions in 10 games to rank third in the nation in passer efficiency (161.2). He also ran for 583 yards (5.0 average) and nine touchdowns before suffering a torn ACL in his left knee at Arizona in November. Few players improved their draft stock as much as Dixon did during the first couple months of the 2007 season.  Unfortunately for Dixon, a knee injury cut his remarkable senior campaign short.  When healthy, Dixon has enough redeeming qualities as a developmental project to consider drafting in the middle rounds.  He has always been blessed with a great frame, a strong arm and excellent athletic ability.   However, in order to compete for a starting job in the NFL, he must improve his bulk, strength and overall efficiency as a passer.  And that's assuming  he makes a full recovery. While his upside is intriguing, Dixon has entirely too many strikes against him to warrant consideration in the first three rounds.  A team willing to take that type of risk must consider these four hurdles: 1) He must recover from ACL tear.  2) He only starred for two months of one season (less than another one-hit wonder from Oregon, Akili Smith).  3) He comes from a spread offense that has not translated well to the NFL.  4) There is very little assurance he will choose to play football professionally instead of returning to the baseball field.","Dixon's stock dropped after he suffered a knee injury late last season. But he made great strides as a passer last season and has great speed to develop into a reserve receiver. He could be the heir to Charlie Batch, and in the meantime, could see some time as a receiver. His ability to throw the ball allows the Steelers to work in some gadget plays.

Johnson is one of the most intriguing prospects in the 2008 class. He needs to add bulk to his tall but lanky frame and he still has much room to improve in terms of reading coverage and making his progressions.  However, he is a confident player with underrated passing skills and outstanding mobility.  He answered some questions regarding his ability to make the leap from a non-scholarship FCS program to the NFL when he stood out as the most electrifying playmaker in the East-West Shrine game.  Most importantly, he proved that he's not just a running quarterback by remaining patient in the pocket and going through his progressions before opting to run as a final option.  Johnson is still very much underrated in our opinion and he's worth the investment in Round 3.","The learning curve is higher for Johnson after playing at a small school. He is going to have to learn how to read the more complicated defenses in the NFL but has tremendous potential. He has quick feet and is dangerous as a scrambler, and he rarely tucks and runs too soon. He also has a strong arm.

He enrolled at Saddleback Community College (Calif.) in 2004, completing 68.3 percent of his passes for 281.3 yards per game, 23 touchdowns and just four interceptions in nine games. He transferred to Hawaii in 2005 and went on to set an NCAA Division I-A record in career total offense per game (387.89).

Brennan is not as athletic or nearly as polished as Jeff Garcia.  But like Garcia, he is very slightly built and has to really load up to throw the deep ball. Also like Garcia, Brennan is light on his feet and is very accurate. There's a lot to like about his confident, gun-slinging mentality.  However, there also are a lot of red flags to consider when evaluating his risk-reward level, including marginal size, below-average arm strength, off-the-field history and spread system that has not translated well to the NFL in past years.  Brennan isn't for every system at the next level and his ability to cut heavy winds or bad weather should be a concern, especially for teams like Baltimore and Chicago.  A warm weather team operating a West Coast offensive system could consider Brennan in the middle rounds, but we wouldn't risk anything higher than a fourth round pick.","Brennan put up outstanding numbers at Hawaii. He's quick enough to buy time in the pocket and accurate enough to lead receivers when throwing underneath.

With the speed in the NFL and the defensive backs' ability to break on and attack the ball, Woodson needs to get this fixed or he risks getting a lot of his out routes taken back the other way for defensive scores.  Furthermore, while he has made significant strides mentally, Woodson still needs to break some bad habits, such as locking on to primary target too frequently.  Woodson still has enough upside to emerge as a solid NFL starter but he must find a way to speed up his delivery without affecting his accuracy as a passer  much easier said than done.  Woodson's stock has taken a sizeable hit from early in his senior season, when he was soaring up draft boards following big performances versus Louisville, Arkansas and LSU.  Woodson is a bit of an enigma right now but he should come off the board in the second-to-third round range.","The hitch in Woodson's release played a big role in his poor showing at the Senior Bowl and caused his stock to plummet.

For his career, Brink ran for a total of 98 yards and five touchdowns. Brink possesses a good blend of accuracy and mobility but he doesn't have prototypical size and lacks prototypical arm strength.

He gets into too much trouble when he fails to step into his throws and/or tries to make too much happen. Brink projects as a rookie free agent.","He has adequate feet, good pocket awareness and has shown solid ability to buy time in the pocket.

Is Ponder the immediate answer? Will the Vikings still go out and try to get a veteran to bridge the gap? Bill Musgrave is the new coordinator and he will run a West Coast offense that emphasizes the run with <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=10452"">Adrian Peterson</a> and his philosophy will emphasize rollouts, bootlegs, half reads and play-action -- all things Ponder can do well.",

<b>How he fits</b>: With <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=4459"">Carson Palmer</a> continuing to be very firm in his decision to not play for the Bengals, they are left with his brother <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=10648"">Jordan Palmer</a> and <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?playerId=13202"">Dan LeFevour</a>, and that's not good enough.

<p><b>How he fits:</b> This appears to be a perfect fit of a quarterback's skill set with the Colts' new offensive philosophy. Offensive coordinator Bruce Arians will run a Pittsburgh-style scheme with a lot of bunch formations and movement and some no-huddle. Luck will have a lot of freedom to audible at the line of scrimmage. They want to be a much more run-oriented offense which could set up good play action, which is Luck's strength. This is a perfect offense for him, it's just a shame he won't have a better supporting cast in the beginning.

While there are concerns about the pro-style offense, he's done it enough in college that you know he'll be successful in the NFL.
If Luck is 1, then RG3 is 1A. In fact, he has an even stronger arm and he moves just as well. If he stays healthy, he'll be the quarterback Washington so desperately needed and well worth the picks they gave up to get him. </p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b> He is a perfect guy to run Mike Shanahan's offense, which is a strong zone-blocking run game and a passing game that wants the QB to roll out, throw a lot of bootlegs and motion some off play action and that leads to a lot of half-field reads and scrambles, which fits RG3 perfectly. They will also use a lot of motions and shifts and multi-receiver packages to give him a lot of options in the passing game. He will always be a threat to tuck the ball and run. They worked hard to give him a supporting cast in free agency.

Tannehill is one of the most talked-about prospects in this draft. On one hand, there are concerns about his lack of experience and his inability to win games late last year. On the other hand, he has all the physical tools and mental toughness teams look for in a starting quarterback.
It's also important to point out that he's more accurate than the numbers suggest, because his receivers dropped so many balls last year that it skewed his completion percentage and hindered his ability to win games. </p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
This is certainly a pick that seems to make a lot of sense because the Dolphins know everything about this guy with Miami offensive coordinator Mike Sherman as his former head coach at Texas A&M. Tannehill has a tremendous skill set, but there's a lot of room to develop. Under new head coach Joel Philbin, the Dolphins' offense is a version of a West Coast offense with a large variety of formations and personnel packages, much like he ran at Green Bay as offensive coordinator. This is a sophisticated offense that puts a premium on decision-making and reads, and Tannehill just needs time to recognize matchups, see blitzes and learn how to audible at the line of scrimmage. These are all things he can do, that he will likely sit for a good portion of his rookie season and will learn behind Matt Moore or David Garrard. This is not a QB to start from day one.

However, there are concerns about his ability to make sound decisions under pressure. He has to improve his ability to beat the blitz. His age (28) is a concern, but it's not a significant red flag. If he starts early in his career, they can still get six or seven years of quality football out of him. </p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b>
He certainly looks like the QB of the future and that future needs to be now for a 28-year-old. He can make every throw necessary to eventually fit in this West Coast offense and he can make all the required reads. He's coming from a college system in which he ran a lot of spread formations with quick passes and easy reads. And in this West Coast look, his passes will have to become more disciplined and his reads more focused. His ability to handle the blitz must improve dramatically, but having Trent Richardson in the fold could make his job easier. As fast as you want him to get into the lineup, it is likely he will learn in the first half of the season to improve that decision-making behind Colt McCoy. If he makes the right progress, he could be their starter in the last two months of the season.

Osweiler has exceptional size at nearly 6-foot-7, and has above-average athleticism considering his length. While he's a bit raw and needs to work on his mechanics, he flashes tremendous upside with a quick release, a strong arm and natural accuracy. 

</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b>
The Broncos have hopefully learned that as great as Peyton Manning is, he needs a quality backup. He didn't have it in Indy, but Osweiler is that guy in Denver. He's a big with a tremendous skill set and he's playing behind Manning. He can take his time to play under center and run an NFL offense as opposed to the spread packages in college. Right now, Caleb Hanie is the backup and Osweiler will be No. 3 for this year, but look for him to be developed the way Aaron Rodgers was behind Brett Favre. This is a great spot for him.

Of course there are concerns about his height and how it's going to affect his ability to scan the field, but if he's 4 inches taller, he's probably a top-10 pick. He's a great leader, he makes sound decisions, he's accurate and he has more than enough arm strength to make it in the NFL.

</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
His lack of size has been well-documented, but other than that he has every quality you are looking for in a QB. Initially, this doesn't look like a need for the Seahawks with their acquisition of Matt Flynn, but backup Tavaris Jackson has only one year left on his contract and they like young, developmental guy Josh Portis a little bit. And we really don't know if Matt Flynn can be the guy. At the very least, Wilson can move up to a solid No. 2 guy. He will be a pleasure to coach.

While he doesn't have the pocket mobility you'd like to see in the modern-era quarterback, he can beat pressure with a quick release. He also has a strong arm and above-average accuracy. 

</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
You would not think this is a position of need, but Michael Vick is over 30 and his contract is up after this season. Backup Mike Kafka knows the system but is not special nor is UFA pickup Trent Edwards. Andy Reid loves to develop young QBs. He has at least a year to see if Foles can be that guy. The Eagles are always aware that their young guys can either become a starter or become trade bait.

Cousins makes up for his average pocket mobility and arm strength with accuracy, sound decisions and leadership. He may never develop into a starter, but he could and should quickly develop into an excellent backup.

At first glance, this looks like a luxury pick because his chances of competing with RG3 are minimal. But Cousins has the instincts and the skills to run Mike Shanahan's offense. He has a chance to run it more effectively early as RG3 learns the offense. He can be an excellent backup and he should be a great quarterback meeting teammate as these two young guys learn the system together.

You just got the feeling that this new coaching staff, under Doug Marrone, wanted to start with its own guy. The Bills already had a couple quarterbacks on their roster with Kevin Kolb and Tarvaris Jackson, and it's interesting that they passed on Geno Smith and Ryan Nassib. Manuel's upside could be very intriguing, although this coaching staff has been very secretive about its offensive philosophy. We will likely see creative personnel groupings, an up-tempo passing game with some read-option wrinkles and perhaps even see an old version of the K-Gun offense that the Bills ran years ago with Jim Kelly. This is a coaching staff which can afford the time to bring along Manuel, and it already has a potentially good run game to take some pressure off him. This selection seems to tell us this is going to be a very creative offensive package. It will be fun to watch, with a variety of exotic looks.",

In particular, his footwork and mechanics need work, which will help improve his intermediate-to-deep accuracy, which is inconsistent at times. However, he is a fierce competitor who can become dangerously efficient when he catches a rhythm. And while he is a pocket passer first and foremost, he has the athleticism to turn a negative into a positive when the play breaks down. He won't turn around the franchise immediately, but if handled the right way Smith could turn into a solid starter. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> It's really not a surprise that this position has been a mess, and it looks as if the Jets have decided to break up this group and start over. Mark Sanchez will probably have one more year -- maybe as the starter -- but with a coaching staff that has a short leash. Smith might be pushed to play earlier than expected.

And he moves well in the pocket fairly well for his size, and does a great job keeping his eyes downfield when eluding the rush. He will miss some easy throws a times, and also needs to show more competitiveness as a leader and develop the ability to shake off mistakes. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This pick would certainly suggest that this coaching staff may not fully believe in Josh Freeman as the long-term answer at quarterback. Freeman continues to have inconsistent streaks and make bad decisions, and Glennon has a good enough skill set to potentially develop into a good player. He will likely start as Freeman's backup, which would give him a year of development.

When able to throw with rhythm and timing, he has the anticipation and accuracy to succeed and develop into an adequate starter. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> On one hand, this did not look like a critical need because the Eagles already have Michael Vick, Nick Foles and Dennis Dixon. But with a new coaching staff, you get the feeling Chip Kelly would like to develop his own guy.

<b>How he fits:</b> This is obviously a value pick for the Giants as they looked at who was left on their board. They have one solid backup behind Eli Manning in veteran David Carr.

He will have a chance to sit, learn and develop, which could help him become an above-average starter down the road. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> We never think of the Steelers as a team with a QB need because Ben Roethlisberger is so tough and dependable, although his playing style leaves him open to injuries. They have not had a legitimate backup for a long time. Right now, veteran Bruce Gradkowski is in that role, but there doesn't seem to be a feeling that he could step in and thrive if Big Ben were to go down.

<b>How he fits:</b> This is a team with multiple needs, but it has no chance unless it has a quarterback to build around. Bortles will be that guy. Without a legitimate run game and a so-so offensive line, he will be under a lot of pressure. With marginal pass protection and poor blitz pickup, we will see a lot of slants and quick crossing routes with safe passes designed for yards after catch. Bortles will use screen and draw plays and would excel in play-action if the Jaguars can develop a decent run game.

Plus, his off-the-field behavior has some wondering if he'll be the kind of leader who's the first player in and the last player out of the building. On the plus side, he's a fierce competitor when he takes the field, he has above-average arm strength and he is an escape artist who can buy time for his receivers to get open and break long runs when he gets a lane to scramble.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Manziel is a pick who will energize the Browns' fan base, and they were able to get him in a desirable part of the round. Offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan knows how to coach a mobile quarterback because he did so with RG III in Washington, and Manziel has similar qualities. We will see bootlegs, rollouts and a lot of West Coast principles. Manziel will work out of the shotgun with creative personnel groupings and spread looks.

His ability to handle and beat pressure also stands out. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> 2011 first-round pick Christian Ponder hasn't panned out, and the Vikings declined his fifth-year option. The short-lived Josh Freeman experiment didn't work out either, and he's signed with the Giants. Matt Cassell is an adequate stopgap, but he isn't the long-term answer. As well as general manager Rick Spielman has drafted overall, it's a quarterback-driven league, and the bottom line is he missed on Ponder. Bridgewater's average arm strength is a concern when it comes playing in the NFC North, but he was the top-ranked quarterback on our board at one point and he's a cerebral quarterback capable of mastering offensive coordinator Norv Turner's offense. There's also a lot to like about Spielman's aggressiveness trading up into the first round to ensure that Houston didn't take Bridgewater with the 33rd overall pick.  ",

He's also an accurate short-to-intermediate passer when he's in rhythm and his production at Fresno State was outstanding. He's still a reach this early in the draft, though, and the reason is he doesn't handle pressure. He shows below-average poise and frequently fails to follow through with defenders in his face. In addition, his completion percentage has been inflated by the high percentage of passes he threw within 5 yards of the line of scrimmage.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This was a need pick for an offense that has a bridge guy in Matt Schaub, but Oakland's QB position has been a revolving door for years and it needs to solve it soon. Carr fits nicely in the West Coast offense, using short-to-intermediate passes with the ball coming out quickly, leading to YAC.

<b>How he fits:</b> With Tom Brady still producing at a high level and a still-developing Ryan Mallett on the roster, another QB wasn't a need for New England. But this pick was all about selecting the best available athlete, and Bill Belichick & Co. love to groom young QBs as future trade bait. Garoppolo has solid physical tools and can make every throw.

However, he has excellent athleticism and mobility to work off schedule. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Thomas is the ultimate developmental pick. He's not ready to play now but boasts all the physical tools to be successful: big arm, excellent work ethic and size. He was inconsistent because of a marginal supporting cast at Virginia Tech, but his tools and drive could help him succeed. Carson Palmer, who is still performing at a high level, affords the Cardinals time in developing Thomas, making this an astute pick and well worth the gamble.

For all of his skills (big arm), there are several concerns (slow, coming off an ACL injury and off-the-field issues).

He will put Winston in position to succeed without asking too much of him early, but he prefers to run an up-tempo, no-huddle offense, so he will likely move toward that once Winston gets acclimated to the offense and his teammates.  There's a lot to like from the personnel standpoint, as well.  Wide receiver Mike Evans is a big target who wins 50-50 balls, much like Kelvin Benjamin did for Winston in 2013, plus tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins is a talented receiver whom Koetter is expected to feature.

His ability to improve his accuracy and overall efficiency on throws that require anticipation - as he transitions from Oregon's up-tempo spread system to an NFL offense -- will be critical to his success.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Mariota doesn't fit the mold of prototypical pocket passers -- such as Philip Rivers and Ben Roethlisberger -- with whom head coach Ken Whisenhunt has had past success. Whisenhunt will have to adapt his philosophies toward Mariota's dual-threat skill set early on by consistently using his mobility and changing the launch point as he develops as a pocket passer.

He needs to improve his decision-making, and he played in a scheme that ran a lot of screens and quick-hitters that simplified his reads. However, he was also asked to go through full-field progressions on several throws, and he showed above-average vision on those plays. One area of concern is durability. He's had some problems staying healthy, and he's lean at this point.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Drew Brees is 36 years old -- time catches up with all players at some point. In addition, Luke McCown turns 34 this year, and it's unlikely that 2013 college free-agent signing Ryan Griffin is the long-term answer.

He also has quality arm strength and can be accurate at all three levels when he's on balance and has room to throw. Mannion has similar traits to Tampa Bay QB Mike Glennon and could end up sticking in the league for 10 to 12 years as an adequate backup with a chance to develop into a starter.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Rams traded for Nick Foles this offseason, but he's in the last year of his contract, missed the final eight games of the 2014 season with a broken collarbone and didn't play nearly as well to start the season as he did in 2103.

Lynch is a developmental prospect and this is a bit of a reach, as he needs to work on his ability to read coverages and isn't ready to start right away. However, he has great size, a strong arm and his mobility makes him a good fit for head coach Gary Kubiak's offense. -- Steve Muench",

His best season was as a freshman under then-head coach Bill O'Brien (Texans). Hackenberg has ideal size, a big-league arm and adequate pocket mobility. In order to succeed in the NFL, his decision making must continue to improve, and he must become more consistent with his footwork in order to elevate his accuracy. -April 9, 2016","<b>What he brings:</b> Hackenberg is a tough evaluation. On one hand, his size, arm strength and the potential he showed as a freshman make him an intriguing Day 2 prospect. Plus, while you don't want to make excuses, his porous pass protection and average receiver play factored into his subpar production the past two seasons. On the other hand, his underwhelming tape, career completion percentage (56.1 percent) and ball placement are significant concerns. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> The Jets have a pressing need at quarterback considering Ryan Fitzpatrick remains unsigned, Geno Smith isn't the long-term answer and Bryce Petty may never develop into a starter. In addition, offensive coordinator Chan Gailey is capable of unlocking Hackenberg's considerable upside, so Hackenberg could be the long-term answer. However, he developed plenty of bad habits the past two seasons and he needs a lot of work; ideally he doesn't start this year.  -- Steve Muench",

State and sitting out 2013 (NCAA transfer rules). He emerged as the fulltime starter at N.C. State in 2014 and completed 60-percent of his throws with a 4.7-to-1 TD-INT ratio during his two seasons at the helm (15-11 as starter). Brissett has the tools and work ethic to develop into a very good backup QB in the NFL (with an outside chance of emerging as an adequate starter), which we believe is worthy of a Day 2 grade. --February 11, 2016","<b>What he brings:</b> Brissett, who transferred from Florida to NC State, started the past two seasons for the Wolfpack and completed 60 percent of his passes as a senior. There's a lot to like about his frame and pocket mobility. He also has more than enough arm strength to succeed at the NFL level. However, there's room for improvement when it comes to ball placement as he misses within the strike and forces receivers to adjust too much. He has the potential to develop into a valuable backup and effective spot starter. 
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> The courts have reinstated the league's four-game suspension of Tom Brady, and Jimmy Garoppolo is the only other quarterback on the roster, so quarterback is a need for New England. Though some felt that the Patriots would address this need by signing a veteran, Brissett is an intriguing developmental prospect who has a knack for extending plays. -- Steve Muench    ",

Kessler lacks ideal height, has below-average arm strength, and his deep accuracy is too inconsistent at this point. But he is very accurate on short-to-intermediate throws, has outstanding football intelligence, and extends a lot of plays with his awareness and sneaky quickness. In a precision-based system, Kessler can be a good backup in the NFL, which is why we give him a Day 3 grade. -April 10, 2016","<b>What he brings:</b> Kessler was a three-year starter with a 27-16 career record for the Trojans. He lacks ideal measurables and has physical limitations, including a lack of ideal arm strength to stretch the field vertically. On the flip side, he is a cerebral signal-caller with experience running a pro-style progression read system, and he has very good poise and awareness in the pocket. Kessler also shows adequate touch and accuracy in the short-to-intermediate part of the field. He has a chance to develop into a functional backup for a team that implements heavy West Coast principles predicated on getting the ball out quickly with rhythm and timing. -- Kevin Weidl

He became more comfortable with his reads and showed better anticipation as a passer. He has average arm strength and mobility, and while he was a bit better with his accuracy in 2015, he remains too inconsistent in that critical area.

His interview process and one-on-one time spent with NFL decision makers will likely determine whether he's a late-first round selection or second rounder. -- February 8, 2016","<b>What he brings:</b> Cook is a proven winner in a pro-style offense. He has the frame, arm strength and pocket mobility to develop into an effective starter. His footwork and accuracy are concerns, though. He misses too many routine throws, and he forces receivers to adjust to passes hindering their ability to produce after the catch. There are also concerns about Cook's ability to command an NFL huddle and locker room. -- Steve Muench
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> Quarterback Derek Carr obviously isn't in any danger of losing his starting job, but general manager Reggie McKenzie is wise to improve the depth behind him.

He took a big step functioning as a passer from inside the pocket this year turning a career best in completion percentage (66%) and TD-to-INT ratio (32-5) all while taking a step-back with supporting cast. He still needs to continue to work on quickening his process from his footwork, release and anticipation. However, Prescott has a strong tool box to work with in terms of size, arm strength and mobility. He projects as a mid-round pick.

Though he was arrested on a DUI charge in March, he had shown strong leadership and football makeup before the arrest. Prescott has to continue to work on his footwork, release and anticipation, but he has the frame, pocket mobility and enough arm strength to develop into an effective backup and spot starter. He's also a threat to take off and run. <br>
<b> How he fits:</b> Tony Romo turns 36 in April, broke his left collarbone twice in 2015 and played in just two full games.  He hasn't played in all 16 games since 2012.

Hogan, however, has the size, mental makeup, accuracy and pocket mobility to develop into a solid backup.<br>
 <b> How he fits:</b> Kansas City is a great fit for Hogan who lacks ideal physical tools, particularly arm strength, but is a cerebral quarterback who can make quick decisions within Andy Reid's West Coast system.

His growth throughout his career is a classic example of how valuable experience is for the development at the position. Still, Rudock needs work with mechanics, accuracy and has room for growth as a decision maker.

He also has been through a lot of adversity and scrutiny from fans early in career (Had his truck egged and set on fire) and showed the mental toughness to work through it.

Per NFL scouts and their sources within the program: Mond loves the game and puts in extra work to make sure he understands the game plan and concepts. He does a good job of working with coaches to make in-game adjustments. He's still developing as a leader and learning how to demand the most out of his teammates.
